# Portfolio
Hey, I'm Tiernan Kingzett and this is a portfolio of some of the projects I have developed.

All of the projects in this portfolio have been designed within Unity, making use of a few external assets.
My personal focus is within systems design, largely in putting core systems in place to make rapid design iteration easy.

Within each project I have included a build which can be downloaded and run independently, in some projects this is alongside folders of the scripts and assets I created for the projects.

If you have any questions or comments on any of my projects I would love to hear feedback.
I can be contacted by email at tiernankingzett@gmail.com
