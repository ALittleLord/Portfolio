# Portfolio
Hey, I'm Tiernan Kingzett and this is a portfolio of some of the projects I have developed.
You can also view my portfolio TiernanKingzett.com

All of the projects in this portfolio have been designed within Unity, making use of a few external assets.
My personal focus is within systems design, largely in putting core systems in place to make rapid design iteration easy.

Within each project I have included a build which can be downloaded and run independently, in some cases I included some of my created scripts.

Simply Sudoku, as is released, just has information on the project and the to download the app on Google Play: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.LittleLordStudios.SimplySudoku

If you have any questions or comments on any of my projects I would love to hear feedback.
I can be contacted by email at tiernankingzett@gmail.com
