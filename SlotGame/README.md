# SlotGame
SlotGame (dev title) is a slot machine based spin on the deck builder genre.\
It is one of my earliest projects I made and as a result is rough to the point that I would rewrite it probably from scratch if I were to return to it.\
This project made use of a handful of assets, primarily the use of OdinInspector to make an easy system to create new tiles, decks, and enemies.\
I have included SlotGame.exe that can be run to play the game, as well as my project Created Asset folder, and a Created Scripts folder with duplicates of all my scripts in one place.\

### This project includes:
 - A system in place to easily develop tiles and enemies
 - Loading of enemies and enemy variants
 - A slot machine to shuffle and draw tiles
 - Aura tiles to apply affects to surrounding tiles
 - A running game loop with adding tiles to deck, and healing to survive longer

### To Play
 - Click Start
 - Pull Lever to spin slot
 - Click on tiles to select, and on characters to use when selected
 - Aura tiles affect adjacent tiles]
 - At fight end pick a new tile and use a rest site to heal or continue to your next fight
