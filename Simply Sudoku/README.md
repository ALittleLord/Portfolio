# Simply Sudoku
Simply Sudoku is a Sudoku App I created in the Spring of 2022. It is the first project of mine to be fully released, currently on the Google Play Store at https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.LittleLordStudios.SimplySudoku \

After being disappointed by the sudoku apps I had access to, and thinking about how fun it would be to write an algorithm to generate puzzles I decided to make my own.\

Simply Sudoku was designed with two core principles in mind: removing bloat while giving the user as much control as possible over the game experience.\

The finished product has virtually unlimited puzzles over five difficulties as well as Daily Puzzles.\

It also allows players to pick between many color palettes, use Icons instead of numbers, remove non-essential UI elements they don't want to use or see, and change how some features work.
