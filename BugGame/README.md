# Bug Game
Bug Game is an unfinished project which was being developed for Game-Off 2021.\

It was built in partnership with Austin Dwyer.\

It is a stealth game with a primary focus on field of vision, where enemies disappear when not in characters sight lines and 'Bugs' can be planted to extend detection range to areas in various ways.\


As other things got in the way of completing this project for the jam it is in a very alpha state.\

Along with UI work, and movement scripts, my core work on this project was in two areas:

- The Detection system which hides enemies when they are not visible by player based on sight lines from players head
- The MiniMap which renders scene with depth as white walls, as well as showing the player as a green icon, and enemies as red icons
